chatroom
========

Example of a use for the Mediator pattern with a chatroom and installation with CMake similar to that demonstrated by [Derek Molloy](http://derekmolloy.ie/hello-world-introductions-to-cmake/).

Three methods of installation are provided :

1. A single executable file :

  ```
  $ ./simple_install.sh
  ```

2. A static library :

  ```
  $ ./static_install.sh
  ```

2. A shared library :

  ```
  $ ./shared_install.sh
  ```

For more info, investigate the `.sh` files, the `CMakeLists.txt` files in directory `cmake_use_cases`, and the resulting `Make` files and libraries in the `build` directory.
